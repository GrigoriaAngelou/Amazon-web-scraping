# Amazon web scraping

Amazon web scraping is a file where I use python to extract the title and the price of a product from an Amazon page.
I use a function named check price in order to trace the price of this item everyday and add it in a dataset.
In the end I use an if statement to sent me an email if this price be lower than 14$.
